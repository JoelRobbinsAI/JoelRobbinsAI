**Joel Robbins – AI Conversation Designer**

I design and deploy AI agents that feel like natural conversation partners—systems that maintain context, adapt to users, and deliver structured results through thoughtful interaction design.


[Try the CDFW Hatchery Agent](https://github.com/JoelRobbinsAI/Design_Work/blob/main/CDFW-hatchery.md) – A bilingual voice guide I built in Python for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.


**What I Do**

I build functional AI agents using Python and sophisticated prompt architectures. My work focuses on conversation design: creating agents that track context, maintain consistent personas, and handle complex workflows naturally.

My 20+ years in Chinese medicine and health education taught gave me a deep understanding of human dynamics and an appreciation for nuanced interaction. Combined with training in AI Agent Development, Python, Prompt Engineering and AI ethics, I create agents that work in the real world: content assistants, health coaches, workflow automation, and specialized tools.
