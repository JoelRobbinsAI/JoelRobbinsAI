# Portfolio Repo
Portfolio of AI agents, prompt engineering, and interaction design work

Hi, I’m Joel Robbins. I design agents and prompt methodologies to explore how humans and AI can work together with more depth and clarity.  

This is my profile repo, where you can learn about my philosophy and my credentials.  

For the rest of my design work, visit my [Design Repo](link-to-design-repo).  
To try something right away, here’s a [Runnable Example](link-to-example).  

Having a bachelor’s in dietetics and a master’s in acupuncture, I bring high-level reasoning to AI systems design, creating agents with dynamic, evolving interactions. I hold full specializations in Prompt Engineering, AI Agent Development, and Responsible Generative AI, and have completed additional courses in Python and LangChain.

I build real-world AI assistants that maintain a persona and interact naturally in voice or text, keeping track of context, structured information, and user goals across a dynamic conversation. My designs often make use of a setup phase, where the AI begins by asking targeted questions to gather key details before the main interaction. This ensures the assistant has a clear foundation to work from, allowing it to hold coherence across the session while adapting fluidly to user needs. The agent then acts as a living, responsive partner, helping the user in ongoing tasks while evolving with their workflow.

The agents I build serve practical purposes, from assisting users with content creation, health coaching, and assessment, to supporting complex workflows in trading or other tasks. Each agent is structured to provide dynamic, context-aware interactions tailored to the user’s needs, maintaining a natural, ongoing dialogue while delivering actionable results.

I’m also developing a specialized AI prompt language (DSL) to bring more structure and efficiency to prompt engineering. Still evolving, this work reflects my commitment to creating practical, scalable AI interactions. I’m continually refining my skills and learning new tools, recognizing that AI systems design is a rapidly evolving field, and I strive to stay up to date while expanding my capabilities.
