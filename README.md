# Portfolio Hub
Portfolio of AI agents, prompt engineering, and interaction design work

​Hi, I’m Joel Robbins. I design AI agents and prompt methodologies to facilitate human-centric AI assistants that act as natural, responsive partners.

This is my profile hub, where you can learn about my philosophy and my [Credentials](Certifications.md).

With a bachelor’s in dietetics and a master’s in acupuncture, I bring a deep understanding of human dynamics and interpersonal relationships to my work. My unique background informs my approach to designing AI agents that maintain context awareness and a nuanced conversational ability, allowing them to assist with various real-world tasks. This practical experience is complemented by my formal training, which includes specializations in Prompt Engineering, AI Agent Development, and Responsible Generative AI, along with additional coursework in Python and LangChain.

I build real-world AI assistants that maintain a persona and interact naturally in voice or text, keeping track of context, structured information, and user goals across a dynamic conversation. These agents serve practical purposes, from assisting users with content creation, health coaching, and assessment, to supporting complex workflows in trading or other tasks. Each agent is structured to provide dynamic, context-aware interactions tailored to the user’s needs, maintaining a natural, ongoing dialogue while delivering actionable results.

I’m also developing a specialized AI prompt language (DSL) to bring more structure and efficiency to prompt engineering. Still evolving, this work reflects my commitment to creating practical, scalable AI interactions. I’m continually refining my skills and learning new tools, recognizing that AI systems design is a rapidly evolving field, and I strive to stay up to date while expanding my capabilities.
