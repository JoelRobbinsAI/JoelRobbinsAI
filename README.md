Portfolio of AI agents, prompt engineering, and interaction design work

​Hi, I’m Joel Robbins. ​I design prompt methodologies for AI assistants that are natural, responsive partners. I use complex, interconnected prompts to give AI agents a cohesive structure, allowing them to have multi-dimensional conversations and produce structured output.

​My background in acupuncture and dietetics gives me a unique lens for AI. It's taught me to approach problems with a deep understanding of human dynamics, which I use to design context-aware AI agents that have nuanced conversations. My hands-on experience is complemented by formal training in Prompt Engineering, AI Agent Development, and Responsible Generative AI.

​I build real-world AI assistants that maintain a persona and interact naturally, keeping track of context, information, and user goals across a dynamic conversation. Each agent is designed for practical purposes, from assisting with content creation, health coaching and assessment, to supporting complex workflows in trading and other tasks.

​I’m also developing a specialized AI prompt language (DSL) to bring more structure and efficiency to prompt engineering. This ongoing work reflects my commitment to creating practical, scalable AI interactions.
